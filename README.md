# EternalSpace
A little project to train game making. To simplify things, I use an existing game as inspiration:
Endless sky - https://endless-sky.github.io/ - a really good game!

Some basic mechanics are working:
* Flying around
* Landing (with some quirks)
* Jumping to other systems
* Asteroids collide with each other and projectiles, but not with ships
* Collision and physics are determined by the outline of ships/objects
* Basic mission system
  * Dialogs and choices
  * Checks for completion
  * Basic modification on success/failure event
